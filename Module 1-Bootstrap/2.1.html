css/ folder:

Purpose: Contains all the compiled CSS files for Bootstrap.
Key files:
bootstrap.css: The full, unminified Bootstrap CSS.
bootstrap.min.css: The minified version of Bootstrap CSS (smaller file size, faster loading). This is typically used in production.
bootstrap.rtl.css / bootstrap.rtl.min.css: Right-to-Left (RTL) versions for languages that read from right to left.
Files like bootstrap-grid.css, bootstrap-reboot.css contain only specific parts of Bootstrap if you need a more modular approach.

js/ folder:

Purpose: Contains all the compiled JavaScript files for Bootstrap's interactive components (e.g., carousels, modals, tooltips).
Key files:
bootstrap.js: The full, unminified Bootstrap JavaScript.
bootstrap.min.js: The minified version of Bootstrap JavaScript.
bootstrap.bundle.js: Includes Bootstrap's JavaScript and Popper.js (required for tooltips, popovers, and dropdowns). This is the recommended file to include.
bootstrap.bundle.min.js: The minified version of bootstrap.bundle.js.

icons/ folder (If you separately downloaded Bootstrap Icons):

Purpose: Contains the SVG files and font files for Bootstrap Icons, which is a separate library of SVG icons designed to work seamlessly with Bootstrap. It's not included in the main Bootstrap download by default, you need to install it separately (e.g., npm install bootstrap-icons).
Key files: Primarily .svg files for individual icons and font files (e.g., bootstrap-icons.woff, bootstrap-icons.woff2) for using icons as fonts.
